# VIM tips list

## How to use this guide

### Learn vim basic 
You need to know what is normal and insert mode in vim.
Whenever I write
```
:something
```
I mean invoking *something* command in so called normal mode (pressing ctrl+c then typing :something)

#### Use ctrl+c to switch to normal mode
There are two ways to switch to normal mode one is to use escape key, but often more convenienient is to use ctrl+c shortcut

Famous leave vim jokes arouse, because users can't enter the normal mode after editing. 

To quit the editor  you need to do in normal mode

```
:q
```
or if multiple windows are opened close them all

```
:qa
```

### Split windows and navigate between them

The magic command to split vertically is

```
:vsplit
```

and to split horizontally

```
ctrl+w s
```
(a bit counterintuitive I agree)

### Navigating between windows and resize

To move around use

```
ctrl+w [arrow key]
```
command.

#### Resizing 

increase size
```
ctrl+w +
```
decrease size
```
ctrl+w +
```

make windows size equal
```
ctrl+w =
```

Maximize current window

```
ctrl+w _
```

### Use decent plugin manager

One modern and easy to use vim plugin manager is [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## Use file tree plugin

Use NERDTree file tree display in vim - https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree

after install just open it with 
```
:NERDTree
```
in normal mode

## Run Terminal inside vim

Vim has build in terminal plugin. You can open it with
```
:term
```
in the normal mode. This will split your current editor window and create terminal in the upper window.

If you want terminal below current window use
```
:bel term
```


### Copy between editor and terminal

#### Copy from the editor to the terminal

Assume you did copy some text into default register (e.g. by using yy coping line), then you can paste it into terminal by using 
```
ctrl+w ""
```

> note: it is possible to copy from other registers as well. To list registers use the :register command


#### Copy from the terminal to the editor

It's possible to switch terminal into normal read-only editor by pressing

```
ctrl+w N
```
(it's capital N)

In this mode you can copy whatever you like just like in the normal editor window.

To go back to the terminal mode just press *i* (like insert)
