# VIM tips list

## How to use this guide

### Learn vim basic 
You need to know what is normal and insert mode in vim.
Whenever I write
```
:something
```
I mean invoking *something* command in normal mode (pressing ctrl+c then type :something)

## Use ctrl+c to switch to normal mode
There are two ways to switch to normal mode one is to use escape key, but often more convenienient is to use ctrl+c shortcut

## Split windows and trawerse between them

The magic command is to split vertically

```
:vsplit
```

and to split horizontally

```
ctrl+w s
```
(a bit counterintuitive I agree)

### traversing between windows and resize

To move around you can use

```
ctrl+w [arrow key]
```

to resize current window 

increase size:
```
ctrl+w +
```
decrease size:
```
ctrl+w +
```

Easy way to make window equal
```
ctrl+w =
```

Maximize current window

```
ctrl+w _
```


## Use decent plugin manager

One modern and easy to use vim plugin manager is [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## Use file tree plugin

Use NERDTree file tree display in vim - https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree

after install just open it with 
```
:NERDTree
```
in normal mode

## Run Terminal inside vim

Vim has build in terminal plugin. You can open it with
```
:term
```
in normal mode. This will splitt your current edit window and create terminal in upper window.

If you want terminal below current window use: 
```
:bel term
```


### Copy between editor and terminal

#### Copy from editor to terminal

If you coppied some text in different file into default register (e.g. by using yy coping line) then you can paste it into terminal by using 
```
ctrl+w ""
```

> note: it is possible to copy from other registers as well. To list registers use :register command


#### Copy from terminal to editor

It's possible to switch terminal into normal read-only editor by pressing:

```
ctrl+w N
```
(it's capital N)

In this mode you can copy whatever you like just like in the normal editor window.

To go back to terminal mode just press *i*
